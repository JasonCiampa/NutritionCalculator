                    The &quot;Foods and Meals&quot; page is where you will be able to manage the foods and meals in your personal registry.
                    There are three options to choose from on that page:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first option is to &quot;Add/Update a Food&quot;.
                    Upon selecting this option, you will be prompted to provide information about the food you wish to add.
                    This information includes: <br> - The name of the food <br> - The unit of measurement &#40;ounces, grams, cups, or maybe the food itself, like in the case of an egg&#41; <br>
                    - The serving size &#40;how many of your unit of measurement&#41; <br>
                    - The number of calories in one serving<br>
                    - The number of grams of carbs in one serving <br>
                    - The number of grams of protein in one serving <br>
                    - The number of grams of fat in one serving <br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The second option is to &quot;Add a Meal&quot;, which requires you to enter the name of the ingredient&#40;s&#41; alongside the serving size of the ingredient&#40;s&#41;.
                    Meals can contain any number of ingredients, and you can add more ingredients by clicking the &quot;Add Ingredient&quot; button. 
                    Reversely, you can remove the most recently added ingredient by clicking the &quot;Remove Ingredient&quot; button.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The third and final option is to &quot;Remove a Food&#47;Meal&quot;, which requires you to enter the name of the food&#47;meal you'd like to remove.
                    After that is entered, your selection will be removed from the registry and you won't have to provide any further information.
                </p>
            </div>

            <img src="images/foodlog.jpg" alt="">

        <h3 id="todays_nutrition">&quot;Today&apos;s Nutrition&quot;</h3>
        <div id="todays_nutrition_info">
            <div id="todays_nutrition_text">
                <p>
                    The &quot;Today&apos;s Nutrition&quot; page is where you will be able to update and view your calories and macros for the current day.
                    There are two options to choose from on that page:
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The first option will be to &quot;Add a Food&#47;Meal to Today&apos;s Nutrition&quot;.
                    Upon selecting this option, you will be prompted to provide the name and the number of servings for the food/meal you wish to log.
                    The program will then increment the total calories, carbs, protein, and fat for the day based on your inputted food/meal's nutrition facts (and number of servings).
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The second and final option will be to &quot;Remove a Food&#47;Meal From Today&apos;s Nutrition&quot;.
                    Upon selecting this option, you will be prompted to provide just the name of the food/meal you would like to remove from the log.
                    The program will then decrement the total calories, carbs, protein, and fat for the day based on your inputted food/meal's nutrition facts (and number of servings that the program detects).
